## Paper Works 

### Health Insurance

Well there are many insurance companies. 
TK is best for me; because I can reach them 7/24 and they always speak English. 


### Bank Accounts 
If you did not register yourself yet only options are online banks like N26, Vivid.

N26 : You can open a bank account w/ your passport only - and an address.
Vivid : You can open a bank account w/ your passport. You need to provide your tax number in 90 days.
Sparkasse Köln Bonn : You need your tax id, Meldebescheinigung and passport.
